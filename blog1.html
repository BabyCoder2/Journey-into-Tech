    <h2>Day 2:HTML</h2>
    <p>It is now Day 2 of me being consistent with studying. I am almost done with Dave Grays Html course on YT.
        All there is left to complete is the html project.
    </p>
    <p>Let me tell you I am all formed out. lol The last part of the course he was teaching about forms and all I could
        say was again..another form. It was quite fascinating though. I realized too while studying the eagerness I have
        to learn everything quickly so I can secure a job as quick as possible. Well, all I know is that I don't ever
        want an orgianzation to regret hiring me especially seeing that I have no college degree which I do not plan on
        getting.
    </p>
    <p>A quality and effecient web developer is what I am striving to be
        and I will take it one day, one code and one syntax at a time.
