    <h1>Day 3</h1>
    <h2>November 11, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today I honestly didnt want to work on anything has I am exhausted. I still managed to push through
        anyhow and work on the project that Dave Gray had created towards the end of the HTML course.
    </p>
    <p>I managed to finish the course and now I just have to finsih the project. Today I started on a couple sections
        and tomorrow I will aim to finish the project completely.

    <h2>Change is Good!</h2>

    <p>
        I see why people are resisted to change: it's familiar and comfortable. This new space that I
        am in is very much uncomfortable. I know absolutely nothing and that is alright. There was a trainer that would
        always say
        "You have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable". I am uncomfortable ASF.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well that's all that I have for now. My intent behind this blog/diary is to develop the habit of coding everyday
        and to share my journey along the way as well.
