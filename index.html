        It was October 2021 when I was looking for a different career path. I was unsure what I wanted to do but I
        knew
        that
        working as a call center rep was not the ideal career path for me. Being on the phone with such entitled
        people
        really urked my soul that I started to not care anymore. Compassion fatigue is what it was. It was time for
        a
        shift.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started doing some research into tech positions and narrowed it down to non phone tech jobs. That is where
        I
        was introduced to web development. This was the first time in my life that I ever heard about web
        development
        and software
        engineer. Very first time and pondered on why in the hell am I just now learning about this stuff. So I
        started
        Youtubing
        for answers and came across alot of channels.

    <h2>Who Do I Turn To?</h2>

    <p>
        Youtubing how to get into the tech space lead me down a road that was very unhelpful. The information were
        so
        conflicting.
        Some were not giving any information meaning they were holding back or fearmongoring to some of the channels
        were saying why you shouldnt get into this positions. It was so
        discouraging and that's where
        I questioned was this even something I wanted to do. I paid for subscriptions and didn't finish, I stopped
        only
        to venture off into seeing if QA was something I wanted to do instead. Never sought that bootcamp to
        completion.
        I actually
        had the blessing to get a scholarship to participate in Udacity's Frontend development course and I didn't
        complete that...
    </p>
    <h2>The Breaking Point</h2>
    <p>
        I evenutally just stopped and starting focusing on work and still questioned was this even something I
        wanted to
        do.
        It in fact was, I just didnt have guidance and had too many distractions around me. I had to ask myself what
        was
        holding
        me back from completing these courses. 1. I really didn't have the extra finances to invest in a course 2.
        Setting boundaries
        with people to let it be known I am not available as much as I used to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those 2 things really were the main issues. So I decided to go back to the very beginning. Meaning,my very
        first
        course I bought
        was Colt Steeles complete web development course on udemy. I evenutally this year (2024) came across
        roadmap.sh
        where I
        was introduced to Dave Gray. So here you have Dave Gray a profressor and is giving out free content and Colt
        who
        has been
        teaching a bootcamp where students have gone off to get jobs. Surely I am in good hands. Right?
    </p>
    <p>
        The way I see it...I wont know if it works if I dont give it a chance.
